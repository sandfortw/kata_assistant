This script scrapes a codewars url and creates a useful file for working on your codewars challenge in VScode. This was an avenue for me to learn about python. 

After cloning down this file, run
`pip install -r requirements. txt`

After this, you may run `python3 main.py https://www.codewars.com/kata/56efc695740d30f963000557/train/python` to test if things have been installed correctly.

Afterwords, you may substitue in the url with a codewars url of your choice.
